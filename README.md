# Android Application for password generator and manager 
The objective of this project is to handle the main issue of remembering unique passwords for different websites. Our solution is by asking the user to answer some personal questions, the answers would then be used to generate a passphrase, this passphrase would then be used to in order to generate a password which the user can use in his/her website., by just remembering the passphrase the user can get back the password used.<br />

Implemented by creating a rest service which helps in fetching the data from the database, store the encrypted passwords in the database also fetching the said information from the database. <br />

# Technology Used:
1. Android App <br />
2. PHP REST API <br />
3. MySql Db <br />
